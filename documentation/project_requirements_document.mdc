# Project Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview

This desktop application is designed to simplify the discovery and installation process for MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers by offering an intuitive, one-click solution. It aims to eliminate the traditional hassles of manually editing configuration files or using command line instructions, making it accessible to both technical and non-technical users. Users can browse through a curated list of MCP servers, view detailed server information, and install them directly into their preferred MCP client (such as Claude Desktop or Cursor) seamlessly.

The application is being built to streamline how users explore and enhance specific AI capabilities provided by MCP servers. Key objectives include ensuring a smooth and robust user experience, enabling personalized server recommendations through advanced AI integration (using GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet), and making the installation process so simple that even users with minimal technical expertise can benefit. Success will be measured by user engagement, ease of server installation, and a significant reduction in support requests due to improved error handling and intuitive navigation.

## 3. User Flow

When a user launches the application, they are greeted by a clean and modern home screen that highlights featured MCP servers, the latest additions, and personalized recommendations tailored to their interests. Even if they are not signed in, users can browse through various categories of servers, enjoy an intuitive interface with clear navigation cues, and quickly find a server that matches their needs.

For users who decide to sign up with Clerk for account synchronization, the experience extends to include account creation and sign-in. Once authenticated, users can save favorite servers, sync installations across multiple devices, and see personalized insights based on their activity. The typical journey involves browsing, selecting a server to view detailed information, and then clicking a one-click installation button that triggers an automated integration with their MCP client. In case of errors during installation, detailed error messages help guide the user through troubleshooting.
