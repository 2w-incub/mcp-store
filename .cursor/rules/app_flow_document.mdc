# App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new user launches the desktop application, they are greeted with a clean landing screen that introduces the app’s purpose of simplifying the discovery and installation of MCP servers. Users have the option to explore the app without signing in, but those who wish to sync their installations and favorite servers across multiple devices can sign up for an account. The sign-up process is powered by Clerk and supports email-based registration. Users simply provide their email address, set a password, and complete any necessary verification steps. Once registered, returning users can sign in using their email and password. In addition, there is a clear option to recover a lost password directly from the sign-in screen. A link to “Forgot Password” guides users through a straightforward process to reset their password, ensuring that anyone who has forgotten their credentials can quickly regain access to their account. The flow is designed to make it clear when an account is important – such as for syncing installations or favoriting MCP servers – while still allowing exploration without signing in.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After a successful login or when the user chooses to continue without signing in, the user is directed to the main dashboard, which serves as the home screen of the application. This page features a modern, clean design using Tailwind’s slate color as a base with subtle purple accents to emphasize key elements. The dashboard displays a curated selection of MCP servers: featured servers, the latest additions, and personalized recommendations powered by an integrated AI engine. The layout is intuitive, with a header that may display the application’s logo and navigation menus, and a sidebar or navigational panel that allows quick access to key sections like the discovery browser, search function, and user account management. Navigation is seamless, with easy transitions from the dashboard to other areas of the app. The design focuses on clarity and ease of navigation, making every major function quickly accessible from the homepage.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

The application provides a rich discovery experience for exploring MCP servers. From the dashboard, a user can navigate to the discovery section where servers are organized into identifiable categories. Here, users can filter and search for servers using keywords, compatibility criteria, and other specifications. In this intuitive browser, clicking on a server takes the user to a detailed server page. This page offers a deep dive into the server’s capabilities: a clear description, version history with release notes, and compatibility notes that indicate which MCP clients like Claude Desktop or Cursor support the server. Users can also view user reviews, ratings, and important installation metrics. Visual aids such as screenshots and videos are provided to help users understand the server’s functionality. In addition to the details page, there is an installation manager integrated into this flow. When a user clicks the one-click installation button on a server details page, the application triggers an automatic configuration process that integrates the selected server into the user’s preferred MCP client. Behind the scenes, the installation manager handles the necessary configurations, logs detailed error messages if something goes wrong, and even retries installation steps automatically. Users can also report issues via a support or feedback option embedded within the installation experience. The journey is designed to be complete – beginning at discovery and seamlessly moving through server details to installation, all while ensuring that transitions between pages are fluid and intuitive.

## Settings and Account Management

Users who have elected to create an account can access full account management options from a dedicated settings area. This section is accessible via a clearly labeled option on the dashboard or within a drop-down menu accessible from the header. Within the settings, users can update their personal information, change their password, and tweak their preferences, such as adjusting language settings or viewing their installation history. Specific options allow users to manage how their favorite servers are stored and synced across different devices. Although the app can be used without signing in, these personalized settings become accessible only when the user is authenticated. After making updates or modifications, a clear save or confirmation button ensures that users understand that their preferences have been updated successfully. Returning to the main flow is seamless, and any changes immediately reflect on the home screen and within the personalized recommendations.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

The application has been designed with robust error handling and clear messaging in mind. For instance, if a user tries to input invalid data during account creation, or in the process of resetting their password, detailed error messages explain what went wrong and suggest corrective steps. If there is a connectivity issue during the installation of an MCP server, the user is shown a detailed error message that specifies the problem and, where possible, provides troubleshooting steps. The app automatically attempts a retry mechanism in the background for minor connectivity issues, all the while logging the error information for later review. In the case of repeated installation errors, users are given an option to contact support through a feedback feature that leads to a GitHub issues page or other support channel. If users attempt any restricted actions, the system promptly directs them with instructions on how to proceed, ensuring that every error state acts as a temporary detour rather than a dead end. Overall, these mechanisms ensure that users always know how to return to a normal flow without losing their progress.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

From the moment the application is launched, users are embraced by a modern, user-friendly interface that makes discovering and installing MCP servers an effortless process. The initial onboarding and optional sign-up process allow users to decide whether to benefit from advanced features like syncing preferences and personalizing server recommendations via AI integration. Post login, the main dashboard clearly displays featured servers, the latest additions, and custom suggestions based on user interactions. Navigating through the discovery and detailed server pages provides an immersive experience where all critical information – from version history and compatibility details to user reviews – is at the user’s fingertips. Moreover, the one-click installation manager streamlines the process of integrating servers directly into preferred MCP clients such as Claude Desktop or Cursor, while comprehensive error handling ensures that any issues are resolved quickly with clear guidance. Finally, the dedicated settings section empowers users to manage their account and personal preferences easily. Overall, the app flow is designed to be logical and intuitive for both technical and non-technical users. By guiding users through every step – from initial exploration to seamless installation – the application achieves its goal of simplifying the discovery and installation of MCP servers while ensuring a smooth experience throughout the entire journey.
